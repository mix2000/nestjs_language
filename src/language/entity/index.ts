/**
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This file intentionally left empty
 *
 * DO NOT export TypeORM and Sequelize models together!
 * This would load ALL ORM dependencies even when only one is used.
 *
 * To import models:
 * - TypeORM: import from './entity/typeorm'
 * - Sequelize: import from './entity/sequelize'
 *
 * See: language.module.ts for correct usage with lazy loading
